Hello, I'm Danny! üëãüèº I am a linguist. üó£Ô∏è {.intro}

I work to **document and revitalize endangered languages**, while studying the **crosslinguistic patterns we see across the world's languages** (a field known as <dfn class=dfn>linguistic typology</dfn>).

I work primarily with the [Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana][Chitimacha] to help them [revitalize their once-dormant language][GradSlam]. We are using archival materials to produce a modern dictionary and grammar of the language.

**I run the [Digital Linguistics][DLx] (<abbr class=abbr title='Digital Linguistics'>DLx</abbr>) project**, which provides data formats and web-based tools for working with linguistic data.

**I am an avid science communicator**, creating educational videos about language and linguistics for popular audiences on platforms like [TikTok] and [YouTube]. Check out the [Linguistic Discovery website][LingDiscovery] for more!

I earned my M.A. and Ph.D. in linguistics from the [University of California, Santa Barbara][UCSB], and my B.A. in linguistics and philosophy from the [College of William & Mary][WM] in Virginia. Prior to and during graduate school I worked for [Rosetta Stone][RS]‚Äôs [Endangered Language Program][ELP] to create language-learning software with Native American communities.

During my career, I have worked with the [Chitimacha], [Plains Cree][Cree], [Gusii], [I√±upiaq], [Luise√±o], [Mixtec], [Navajo], and [Swahili] language communities.
